Final Review Summer '17

1.	Write a function to print the values in Binary Tree 'in-order' in reverse.  For example:  
		Inorder:  A, B, C
		Inorder reverse:  C, B, A
	
2.	Write a function to determine if an Ordered Tree needs to be rebalanced.
	
3.	Write a search algorithm that:
	a.  First compares the pattern length character to a sequential character in a line of text.
	b.	 If the compare is equal, check the First character in the pattern to the text.
	c.	 If the compare is unequal, skip the pattern length characters in the text and repeat.
	d.  If the first character and pattern length character are the same, check all the characters
		 in the pattern from the first to last character to the text.
	e.	 Repeat from step a. until EOF
	
	*  What is the Big-O of this algorithm?
	*  Will this algorithm skip any valid patterns in the text?
